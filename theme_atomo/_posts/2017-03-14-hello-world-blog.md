Hello everyone, welcome to Sealicon Valley!

The idea of Sealicon Valley came to visit us during one of our casual chats, where we talk about everything, from making android figurines, to Ann's love for Moomin, to Mita's passion about robots and drones.

The characters of the people we meet everyday, and their stories, are truly fascinating. So we thought: how good would it be if we can write them into short stories, and draw them out?

We brainstormed lots of ideas, and the final Sealicon Valley idea was really inspired by our Startup Founder - Narwhal! We all like to refer to super star startups as unicorns, and there really isn't another real life unicorn aside from Narwhals!

As we kept thinking along these lines, the idea of an Investor Shark came to mind - it also fits perfectly with Shark Tank!

We then started adding more animals. As a designer, Ann thought she's very much like a Octopus - tackling lots of projects, tools, and tasks all at once! As a software engineer, Mita chose Dolphin as her character - mainly because she's jealous of Dolphin's sonar system, would be super helpful for tracking bugs!

And don't forget about Bubble! The mysterious super power of Bubble has yet to be revealed..

Aside from the life journey of our fishling friends, we also want to host a FINtastic tech talk series. The presenters, of course, will be our fishies! We want to share the knowledge we learn about design and engineering with you, from the perspectives of our Sealicon Valley villagers.

This is truly exciting for us! Although there are still lots of bugs on the website, lots of assets to be drawn, we can't wait to meet you all! We hope that despite of your busy schedule and crazy itinerary, we'll be able to bring a smile on your face. Just like this - :)
